      <h1>Style Modifiers and Hints</h1>
      <p>
          In many cases, a graphic may need to be changed in some way as it is drawn,
          for instance by highlighting it when the user mouses over it, or by showing
          it as selected. The {@link org.blaise.style.context.StyleModifier} class is used
          to modify styles, and the {@link {@link org.blaise.style.context.StyleHintSet} class
          is included with most graphic objects to describe which modifiers to apply.
          Note that {@code org.blaise.style.context.StyleHintSet} has generic hints like
          "selected" or "highlight", whereas {@code org.blaise.style.context.StyleModifier}
          describes the exact change to take place.
