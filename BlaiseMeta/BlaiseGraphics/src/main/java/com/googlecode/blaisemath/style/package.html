          This package contains the basic styles that draw points, shapes, etc on a
          graphics canvas. These styles contain some basic style information, and
          have the capability to render either a single shape or multiple shapes.
          The four basic styles are {@link org.blaise.style.ShapeStyle} for {@code java.awt.Shape}s,
          {@link org.blaise.style.PathStyle} for {@code java.awt.Shape}s representing paths,
          {@link org.blaise.style.PointStyle} for {@code java.awt.geom.Point2D}s with/without orientations,
          and {@link org.blaise.style.TextStyle} for drawing {@code String}s at a {@code java.awt.geom.Point2D}.
      </p>
      <h1>Code Conventions</h1>
      <p>
          Style classes obey the following conventions:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>classes are <i>not final</i></li>
          <li>classes have a unique <i>toString() method</i></li>
          <li>classes follow <i>Java Bean</i> conventions:
              have a no-argument constructor, 
              and getter-setter methods for all their properties.</li>
          <li><i>property fields are {@code protected}</i></li>
          <li>there is <i>builder pattern</i> for each property, which uses the corresponding {@code set} method</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Style objects have properties that match SVG styling rules
          (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html</a>)
          as much as possible, with styles like {@code font-size} represented by
          <i>CamelCase</i> attributes/properties like {@code fontSize}.
          Remarks are provided with styles that directly match SVG objects,
          and a note is made when they do not.
